*******

0.3 (unreleased)
================

- Document ``importscan`` package that can be used in combination with
  this one.

- Introduced ``factory_arguments`` feature on ``config`` factories,
  which can be used to create dependency relationships between
  configuration.

0.2 (2016-03-29)
================

- Remove clear_autocommit as it was useless during testing anyway.
  In tests just use explicit commit.

- Add a ``dectate.sphinxext`` module that can be plugged into Sphinx
  so that directives are documented properly.

- Document how Dectate deals with double imports.

0.1 (2016-03-29)
================

- Initial public release.
