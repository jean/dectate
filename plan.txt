Extract existing configuration subsystem into this.

Write a few tests.

Refactor so apps store the directives, not the configuration object.

Refactor so that registries are many and can be scoped to directives. *


The apps need to store the actions, not the configuration object.

This allows us to commit for a given number of apps. We also can
automatically commit for all apps.

Committing for an app should automatically also commit for its base app.

Need to separate configuration machinery from Configurable.

Should Configurable be called Configurations? Probably not; we just
create an instance we call Configurations.

Configurations contains info on bases, actions, and sub-objects that
contains the actual configured registries.

The *config* will contain the apps to commit.
